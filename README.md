# MCP Redmine

**Status: Works great, but still in beta**

Let Claude be your Redmine assistant! MCP Redmine connects Claude Desktop to your Redmine instance, allowing it to:

- Search and browse projects and issues
- Create and update issues with full markdown support
- Upload and download file attachments
- Manage and track time entries
- Update issue statuses and fields
- Access comprehensive Redmine API functionality

Uses httpx for API requests and integrates with the Redmine OpenAPI specification for comprehensive API coverage.
